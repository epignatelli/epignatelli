  <summary><h3>My hard skills</h3></summary>
- <ins>Programming</ins> is a second nature to me (C# / .NET, Python, C++, Javascript), as well as agile (and SCRUM) development. `jax`, `pytorch`, `gym`, and anything has got to do with RL and DL.
- Data (structured, unstructured, online), <ins>databases</ins> (noSQL, please) and modelling (Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Physics) yada yada..

  <summary><h3>My soft skills</h3></summary>
  
  
- I love working in groups and I work best in those, with a shared long-term objective and individual short-term responsibilities.

- I am passionate, I do something if I believe in it. If I don't believe in it, I don't do it well. If you want the best out of me, tell me why the task is important, and I'll care for it, and dedicate my time, my mind to it.

<details>
  <summary><h3>My interests</h3></summary>
  
  
- I am interested in <ins>psychology</ins> (especially development psychology and neuropsychology), <ins>neuroscience</ins> and the mind (biological, synthetic, if any).

- I <ins>teach</ins> -- I love teaching -- and I meander through the world -- I love the world -- often looking for quite,
spiritual places far from the noise of the worldly life, seeking for that the ancient, lost craftmanships that every culture has.

- My alter ego (one of many) is a <ins>cook</ins> -- and my send home is a kitchen.
