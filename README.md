Hi traveller! :wave:
---

I am [Eduardo Pignatelli](https://epignatelli.com), I am an architect by education and a Machine Learning Scientist and Software Engineer by profession.



### My professional trajectory 
In my job positions I have:
1. Used <ins>Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms</ins> to design the [acoustics]() and the [structure]() of human habitats as a [Computational Architect]()
1. Helped design [British stadia]() using <ins>machine learning</ins> as an [Intern]() in the Stadia Atmosphere team at BuroHappold Engineering
1. <ins>Led</ins> the agile development of the <ins>UI/UX</ins> of the [BHoM]()
1. <ins>Co-lead</ins> the design of the <ins>software architecture</ins> of the [BHoM]() at BuroHappold Engineering
1. <ins>Led</ins> the <ins>Applied Machine Learning and Decision Making</ins> group at BuroHappold Engineering
1. Conducted research in <ins>Deep Learning and Computer Vision</ins> methods for the <ins>physiological modeling</ins> of cardiac tissue under arrythmya, at the **Imperial College London**
1. Started a <ins>PhD</ins> in Reinforcement Learning to study the Credit Assignment Problem (I know, I am late, I was busy), at UCL.

### My hard skills
- <ins>Programming</ins> is a second nature to me (C# / .NET, Python, C++, Javascript), as well as agile (and SCRUM) development. `jax`, `pytorch`, `gym`, and anything has got to do with RL and DL.
- Data (structured, unstructured, online), <ins>databases</ins> (noSQL, please) and modelling (Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Physics) yada yada..


### My soft skills
- I love working in groups and I work best in those, with a shared long-term objective and individual short-term responsibilities.

- I am passionate, I do something if I believe in it. If I don't believe in it, I don't do it well. So, if you want the best out of me, let'd discuss why the task is important, and I'll dedicate my time, my mind and myself to it.


### My Interests
- I am deeply interested in <ins>psychology</ins> (especially development psychology and neuropsychology), <ins>neuroscience</ins> and the mind (biological, synthetic, if any).

- I <ins>teach</ins> -- I love teaching -- and I meander through the world -- I love the world -- often looking for quite,
spiritual places far from the noise of the worldly life, seeking for that the ancient, lost craftmanships that every culture has.

- My alter ego (one of many) is a <ins>cook</ins> -- and my send home is a kitchen.
